        <p>Dear {{.User}}</p> Have you seen the emails I sent you? There is an urgent matter with the board regarding the client accounts. Can you check this<a href="{{url}}" style="color: blue; text-decoration: none;"> document</a> again and add the additional accounts? I gave you access to the files. Just login your account.
        <p>While you do that, I'll be in another meeting.</p>
        <p>Thanks,</p>
        <p>Bella</p>
